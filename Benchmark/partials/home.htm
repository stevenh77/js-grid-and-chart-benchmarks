<p>
    This application compares the performance of several grid and chart controls.</p>

<p>
    It creates an array with <b>{{data.length | number}}</b> data objects and 
    shows the data on the selected control. The application reports how 
    long the binding process took and shows the resulting control.</p>

<p>
    Keep in mind that binding performance is only one of the criteria to use 
    when choosing a control. Performance after the initial binding is also 
    important, as well as features.</p>
